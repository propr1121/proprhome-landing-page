## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: Default (1200px max-width container)
- **Tablet**: ≤1024px
- **Mobile**: ≤768px
- **Small Mobile**: ≤640px / ≤480px

### Mobile Optimizations ([styles.css:847-918](styles.css#L847))

#### Navigation (≤768px)
- Nav links become full-screen overlay menu
- Hamburger menu appears
- Desktop CTA button hidden

#### Hero Section (≤768px)
- Switches to single column layout
- Video hidden on mobile for performance
- Email form stacks vertically

#### Feature Grids
- 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column progression
- Maintains card spacing and touch targets

#### Floating Pill (≤768px)
- Spans full width with side margins
- Smaller font size for readability

#### CTA Buttons (≤768px)
- Stack vertically
- Expand to full width for better touch targets

## Performance Considerations

### Assets
- **Large video file** (1.4GB `promo-video.mov`)
  - Uses native HTML5 video with autoplay, muted, loop
  - Potential optimization: Convert to modern formats (WebM, MP4) with multiple resolutions
  - Hidden on mobile to save bandwidth

### CSS
- **Single CSS file** (19,665 bytes, well-organized)
- Uses CSS custom properties for theme consistency
- Efficient selectors and minimal specificity conflicts

### JavaScript
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks) - 8,804 bytes
- Event delegation where appropriate
- Intersection Observer for performant scroll animations
- One-time observers that unobserve after triggering

### Icons
- **SVG sprite system** ([icons.svg](icons.svg))
- All icons defined once and reused via `<use>` references
- Scalable without quality loss
- Minimal HTTP requests

### Fonts
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** with preconnect for faster loading
- System font fallbacks for instant text rendering

---

## Accessibility Features

### Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Semantic sectioning elements (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)

### ARIA Attributes
- Tab interface uses proper `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`
- Form inputs have `aria-label` attributes
- Mobile menu toggle has `aria-label`

### Keyboard Navigation ([script.js:194-203](script.js#L194))
- ESC key support for closing menus
- Tab navigation works correctly
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Focus Indicators ([styles.css:944-949](styles.css#L944))
- Custom focus outline in brand color
- 2px outline with offset for visibility

### Motion Preferences ([styles.css:951-957](styles.css#L951))
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query
- JavaScript also checks and disables motion ([script.js:248-255](script.js#L248))

### Skip Link ([styles.css:960-973](styles.css#L960))
- Defined in CSS (though not present in HTML)
- Would allow keyboard users to skip navigation

---

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Modern semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Custom properties, Grid, Flexbox, animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, no dependencies

### Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts**: Inter typeface
- **No analytics** (placeholders in code)
- **No backend** (form submission is placeholder)

---

## How It Functions

### User Journey Flow

#### First-Time Visitor
1. **Lands on page** → Sees hero with compelling value proposition
2. **Scrolls down** → Navigation bar gains shadow (visual feedback)
3. **Explores tabs** → Switches between Agent/Agency/Buyer content
4. **Learns about benefits** → Sees features, differentiators, and trust indicators
5. **Encounters pricing** → At 800px scroll, floating pill appears
6. **Makes decision** → Either submits email or clicks CTA to view Pioneer Program
7. **Takes action** → "Join as Pioneer" alerts user (placeholder for actual signup)

#### Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure**: Content revealed through tabs and scroll
- **Multiple CTAs**: Throughout the page, all leading to Pioneer Program
- **Social proof**: Trust badges, verification indicators
- **Urgency**: "Limited spots available" messaging

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)
1. User enters email → JavaScript validates format
2. Valid email → Alert shown (no actual backend call)
3. Invalid email → Error message displayed below input

**Note**: This is a static site with no backend integration. All form submissions, analytics tracking, and CTA clicks are placeholders that log to console or show alerts.

---

## Future Integration Points

### Backend Requirements
1. **Email capture API** - Store early access signups
2. **Payment processing** - For Pioneer Program enrollment
3. **Analytics tracking** - Replace console logs with real event tracking
4. **CRM integration** - For lead nurturing
5. **User authentication** - For platform access after signup

### Content Management
- Currently hardcoded HTML
- Could benefit from CMS for easy content updates
- Feature descriptions, pricing, and testimonials are prime candidates

### Additional Features
- **Blog integration** (footer link exists)
- **Careers page** (footer link exists)
- **Privacy/Terms pages** (footer links exist)
- **Contact form** (footer link exists)

---

## Browser Compatibility

The site uses modern web standards:
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theming
- **Intersection Observer API** for scroll animations
- **ES6+ JavaScript** features

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome/Edge 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Safari 14+
- Opera 75+

### Fallbacks
- System fonts if Google Fonts fail to load
- Graceful degradation of animations
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Current State
- **Static site** - Can be hosted on any static hosting service
- **No build process** required
- **No dependencies** to install

### Recommended Hosting
- **Netlify**, **Vercel**, **GitHub Pages** - Free tier options
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Fast global CDN
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Scalable solution

### Optimizations Before Launch
1. **Compress video file** - Convert to efficient formats, multiple resolutions
2. **Minify CSS/JS** - Reduce file sizes
3. **Add meta tags** - Open Graph, Twitter Cards for social sharing
4. **Implement proper analytics** - Replace placeholder tracking
5. **Add favicon** - Currently missing
6. **Implement backend** - For email capture and payments
7. **Add sitemap.xml** - For SEO
8. **Add robots.txt** - For SEO management
9. **Optimize images** - Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
10. **Add service worker** - For offline support and faster loads
